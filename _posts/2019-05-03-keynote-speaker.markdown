We have happy to announce that [Prof. Dr. Olivier Curé](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~ocure) from the [University of Paris-Est Marne la Vallée (UPEM)](http://www.u-pem.fr/) will give a keynote entitled **"Analytical processing and reasoning in RDF stores"** at our LASCAR Workshop, [co-located with the ESWC 2019](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/program/#june3). 

For more details, read the abstract and a short bio below:

#### Abstract
Although most production-ready RDF database management systems are equipped with transactional support, one can consider that they do not really fit into the OLTP database category.
In fact, based on typical use cases, they are more closely related to OLAP.
But are they equipped with the operations expected for analytical processing, especially when reasoning is involved?
In this keynote, we will consider this question in the context a selected set of production-ready RDF stores.
