The [LASCAR Workshop Program](/schedule/) is now avaliable.
A great combination of a [keynote about "Analytical processing and reasoning in RDF stores"](/blog/keynote-speaker.html) by [Prof. Dr. Olivier Cur√©](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~ocure/), [paper presentations](/blog/accepted-papers.html), delicious coffee, networking, and panel discussion.

For more details check [the agenda](/schedule/) out. And, yes, do not forget to show up at our workshop on [3rd of June @ESWC2019](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/program/#june3).

Not to be missed!

Looking forward to seeing you [@ESWC2019](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/).
