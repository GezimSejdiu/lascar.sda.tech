# About Block
aboutTitle: "About LASCAR Workshop"
aboutBlock:

 - {title: "About", text: "This workshop on Large Scale RDF Analytics (LASCAR) invites papers and posters related to the problems faced when dealing with the enormous growth of linked datasets, and by the advancement of semantic web technologies in the domain of large scale and distributed computing. We will particularly welcome research efforts exploring the use of generic big data frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or specialized libraries like Giraph, Tinkerpop, SparkSQL etc. for Semantic Web technologies. The goal is to demonstrate the use of existing frameworks and libraries to exploit Knowledge Graph processing and to discuss the solutions to the challenges and issues arising therein. Moreover, we will organize a related talk by an expert speaker, and also arrange a panel discussion among experts and scientists working in the area of distributed semantic analytics. LASCAR targets a range of interesting research areas in large scale processing of Knowledge Graphs, like querying, inference, and analytics, therefore we expect a wider audience interested in attending the workshop." }
 - {title: "Topic of interest", text: "This workshop at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) seeks original “articles and posters” describing theoretical and practical methods as well as techniques for performing scalable analytics on knowledge graphs. The topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to distributed and scalable: <ul> <li>Decentralized KG data management including parsing, compression, partitioning and smart indexing</li> <li>Information retrieval using parallelization or optimization of querying and inference </li> <li>Large scale KG enrichment using link prediction, entity resolution, entity disambiguation or similarity estimation,</li> <li>Machine Learning e.g. clustering, blocking, or anomaly detection</li><li>Complex analytics with distributed KG embeddings </li> <li>Connecting property Graphs with RDF and reasoning </li> <li>Use-cases presenting semantic technologies at industry scale.</li></ul>" }
